#Project23 in The Odin Project

# Blog API

- Perform CRUD operations on blog as a author and add or delete comments under a blog as a viewer 

- A project done as a part of APIs section of The Odin Project web development curriculum.

- This project contains 3 separate entities (1 [API](https://github.com/Punith1117/blog-api) and 2 static sites for ([blog authors](https://github.com/Punith1117/blog-author) and [blog viewers](https://github.com/Punith1117/blog-viewer))

## Try them out live
- [Blog author](https://blog-author-punith1117.netlify.app)
- [Blog viewer](https://blog-viewer-punith1117.netlify.app)

## My Learnings:
1) Benefits of separating frontend and backend 

2) Create RESTful API

3) Implement CORS to protect requests to my API  from unknown origin (Though I have used - origin: '*' - for simplicity)

4) Create two different front-ends to iterate the benefit of separating backend from front end.

5) Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication
